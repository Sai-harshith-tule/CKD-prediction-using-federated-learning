# CKD-prediction-using-federated-learning
This project implements a Federated Learning approach to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in a privacy-preserving manner. By leveraging FL, this model enables decentralized training across multiple healthcare providers without sharing patient data, thereby ensuring data privacy and security.
