# CKD-prediction-using-federated-learning
This project implements a Federated Learning approach to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in a privacy-preserving manner. By leveraging FL, this model enables decentralized training across multiple healthcare providers without sharing patient data, thereby ensuring data privacy and security.

Key features:

Federated Architecture: Uses asynchronous or synchronous federated training across different nodes to maintain data privacy.
CKD Prediction: Predicts CKD risk based on patient health metrics, helping healthcare providers in early intervention.
Data Security: Ensures compliance with data privacy standards by keeping data localized.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates model accuracy using metrics like F1 Score, precision, recall, and AUC.
This project is ideal for research in privacy-preserving machine learning, and scalable healthcare solutions.
